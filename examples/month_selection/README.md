# Month selection datepicker

Uses a different selection type to select just a month in a particular year. Returns a date with the day set to 1.

## Deployed example

## Build

All examples use [Trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) as the build tool.

Once you've installed Trunk, simply execute `trunk serve --open` from this example's directory, and you should see the web application rendered in your browser. Click on the texbox to open the datepicker dialog.
