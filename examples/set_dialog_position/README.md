# Example demonstrating dialog positioning

This example uses the optional parameter of `Msg::OpenDialog()` to set the dialog position according to where the mouse click occured.

## Build

All examples use [Trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk) as the build tool.

Once you've installed Trunk, simply execute `trunk serve --open` from this example's directory, and you should see the web application rendered in your browser. Click on the texbox to open the datepicker dialog.

Click on the title of the dialog to change its scope, between days, months and years.
