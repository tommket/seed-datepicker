This is a customizable Datepicker component for the [Seed framework](https://seed-rs.org/) that uses [Chrono](https://crates.io/crates/chrono) for the date structures.

If you want to use this library, you can use the scss styling that is provided for the examples [here](static/seed-datepicker.scss), or you can make your own styling for it, all you have to do is use the correct class names and their nesting.
